## New work
As a digital humanist with an alt-ac career, I have always had one foot in DH and have kept the other in academic home of Comparative Literature. My current role does not have tenure or the necessity of a portfolio for promotion. Therefore, I have the freedom to write what and when I want. This site has kernels of ideas for work that is squarely in DH and work that talks about the digital in relation to the humanities, particularly to literature, but not necessarily with a DH component.

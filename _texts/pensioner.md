- ALTHOUGH I shelter from the rain
- Under a broken tree,
- My chair was nearest to the fire
- In every company
- That talked of love or politics,
- Ere Time transfigured me.
- Though lads are making pikes again
- For some conspiracy,
- And crazy rascals rage their fill
- At human tyranny,
- My contemplations are of Time
- That has transfigured me.
- There's not a woman turns her face
- Upon a broken tree,
- And yet the beauties that I loved
- Are in my memory;
- I spit into the face of Time
- That has transfigured me.
